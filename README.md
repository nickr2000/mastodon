CSS mods for mastodon 2.5

This is very much a work in process, this style sheet is designed to make your instance as similar as possible to Twitter.

To install you need to be running at least version 2.5 of mastodon. In your administration section go to the Custom CSS input box and paste the contents of rider_theme.css in to the box and click save changes. Job done!

IMPORTANT: This is NOT responsive and will only display correctly on screen resolutions of over 1024px. The Action bar doesn’t display correctly and I haven’t managed to get the media attributes to work in the custom CSS form.

All comments and suggestions welcome. This is a very basic mod and it does need quite a few tweaks as of version 0.1.

Thank you
Nick
